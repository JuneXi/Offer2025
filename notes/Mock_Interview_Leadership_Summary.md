## Google Behavioral Interview Prep: Conflict Resolution Example

### Question:

**Tell me about a time when you had a disagreement with a colleague or teammate. How did you handle it, and what was the outcome?**

---

### STAR Format Answer:

**Situation:**
Our team was building a SMART on FHIR web application that could be embedded in other EHR providers to surface Amazon Pharmacy pricing. This was the first time the team had to own front-end work, and SMART on FHIR was a new area for us.

**Task:**
I was responsible for leading both the High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD). I needed to decide whether to use an existing front-end framework or build it using native AWS components like CloudFront, S3, and Lambda.

**Action:**
The principal engineer (PE) preferred reusing an existing framework, but I believed building with native AWS was more secure, scalable, and easier to manage—especially given the complexity of SMART authentication.

To resolve the disagreement:

* I scheduled one-on-one meetings with teammates to discuss trade-offs.
* I pulled together a living document that tracked open questions, blockers, and answers.
* I pre-reviewed others’ design documents and offered feedback early.
* I shared the document with leadership to show progress and highlight any blockers transparently.

**Result:**
After a thorough technical evaluation and alignment with stakeholders, I was able to convince the PE and team to adopt the native AWS design. The app launched on time and passed the security review with no issues. It was also easier for other teams to adopt and extend in future projects.

### Feedback & Tips:

✅ **Strong points:**

* Clear context: New domain and team ownership.
* Shows initiative: Proactive communication and doc tracking.
* Demonstrates leadership: Bridging opinions and aligning stakeholders.

🛠 **Improvement suggestion:**

* Trim down explanations slightly to fit within 2–3 minutes.
* Emphasize the business impact (e.g., security compliance, launch success).

---

### Rehearsal Pointers:

* Focus on *how* you handled the disagreement, not just *what* the technical debate was.
* Keep a positive tone about the PE’s concerns—show respect.
* Practice articulating "why" your approach aligned with the project’s long-term goals.
